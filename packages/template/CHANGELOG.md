# Changelog

Notable changes to Potluck Docs. This file is for people adopting
or upgrading the template — it describes what changed for *your* docs site, not
every commit.

The template is something you fork rather than install, so a new version is not
something you upgrade into. Use these notes to decide whether a change is worth
pulling across into a site you have already customised.

## 2.7.0

### The footer credit now comes from EkLine's hosted script

`src/components/CustomFooter.astro` no longer holds the credit's words and
mark. It renders an `<ekline-credit>` element and loads
`https://ekline.io/v1/credit.js`, which fills the element in. The credit's
wording and mark now follow EkLine's current credit, so a change to either
reaches your site without a template release and without an edit on your side.
2.6.2 said the footer credit was unchanged; this is the release where it
changes. The script and what it renders are documented at
<https://docs.ekline.io/credit/>.

**What it adds to your site:** each page load requests one script from
`ekline.io`, about 4 KB before compression. The script sets no cookies, stores
nothing in the browser and makes no requests of its own. The host that serves
it sees what any static file host sees — the IP address, the user agent and
the referrer. It is loaded without an integrity hash, because it is meant to
change in place, and it is served unminified so you can read what runs.

**The credit needs JavaScript and that request.** With JavaScript off, or with
the request blocked, the credit is not shown and only the divider above it
remains. Nothing else on the page depends on it.

**If you set a Content-Security-Policy,** allow `https://ekline.io` in
`script-src`, or the credit renders empty. The template sets no policy, so
this applies only if you added one.

**It looks slightly different.** "EkLine" is semibold where it was regular
weight, and the mark is 13px where it was 16px. The divider, the spacing above
it and the text colour are the same. The component dims itself to 85% by
default, which is what 1.0.0 removed from this footer for legibility, so the
file sets it back to full opacity; with the default palette the credit
measures 4.76:1 in light and 6.78:1 in dark.

**What to pull across:** `src/components/CustomFooter.astro`. Then delete
`src/assets/ekline-mark.svg` unless something of yours uses it — the footer
was the only file here that did.

**If you changed or removed the footer credit,** nothing changes for you until
you pull that file across. To keep the credit as plain markup with no script,
keep the file you have.

## 2.6.3

### The repository moved to `ekline-io/potluck-docs`

The command that creates a site from this template changed:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template ekline-io/potluck-docs/packages/template --no-ai
```

GitHub redirects the old path, so the previous command still works — but it
redirects, and redirects are not forever. Update any copy of it you keep in
your own runbooks or CI.

The hosted documentation is now at <https://potluck.ekline.io>, and the live
preview of this template at <https://potluck-demo.ekline.io>.

The previous addresses — `documentation-ekline-docs-template.vercel.app` and
`ekline-docs-template-astro.vercel.app` — still point at these two sites, so a
link you saved earlier is not broken. They name the old product, though, and
nothing guarantees they stay, so prefer the addresses above.

Nothing in the template itself changed: same code, same dependencies, same
defaults. `package.json`'s `name` is now `potluck-docs`, which matters only if
you never renamed it after adopting.

## 2.6.2

### The template is now called Potluck Docs

A rename, and nothing else. No code, configuration, dependency or default
changed between 2.6.1 and 2.6.2, so there is nothing to pull across.

What changed is the name you read: this file, `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` say
Potluck Docs where they said "the EkLine docs template". EkLine still maintains
it, so the footer credit and the LICENSE are unchanged.

The hosted documentation is branded to match. **Your site is not.** The template
still ships the same neutral placeholders — the `My Docs` title, the same
favicon, the same accent palette — because those are there for you to replace
with your own brand.

## 2.6.1

### Replacing the example pages no longer fails `npm test`

Two tests in `npm test` opened this template's example pages — the prose under
`src/content/docs/` — by name. A site that replaced those pages with its own
failed its own suite with nothing wrong with the site, and a site that runs
`npm test` as its build command could not deploy. Measured on a copy of 2.6.0
set up like a real site — another site's 127 pages and sidebar in place of the
examples, its API references disabled, and its private and org example pages
removed: two failures before this change, none after. The same pages with the
API references left on pass too.

This covers the pages and nothing else. Other changes a real site makes still
fail tests; they are listed under *What still fails on a site of your own*
below.

- **`tests/markdown-twins.test.mjs`** checked that `concepts/glossary.md`,
  `get-started/quickstart.md`, `reference/errors.md` and `changelog.md` were in
  the build. It now takes its pages from the build: every page that advertises
  a Markdown twin must have it at `<slug>.md`, with no legacy `<slug>/index.md`
  beside it. It fails when no page advertises one, so an empty build cannot
  pass.
- **`tests/scalar-api-reference.test.mjs`** read
  `get-started/quickstart/index.html` to check the full-width reference's
  sidebar link, and failed on the missing file even with every reference
  disabled. It now reads a page picked from the build — the first, by sorted
  path, whose markup has Starlight's sidebar and is not an API reference — and
  skips when every reference is disabled, like the other tests in that file
  that describe the shipped references.

Two more places had the same problem without failing there. The test that the
operation list is reachable from ordinary docs pages read the same quickstart
page, but skips while references are disabled — so it would have failed the
day such a site turned one on. It uses the same page picker now. And
`tests/visual/api-reference.spec.mjs`, which is not part of `npm test`, skipped
nothing when a reference was disabled, and its search tests started from
`/get-started/quickstart/`. Each of its tests now skips when a reference it
uses is disabled in `src/config/api-reference.mjs` — per reference, so a site
that keeps `payments` and drops `admin` still runs the `payments` tests — and
search starts from `/`.

**What to pull across:** `tests/markdown-twins.test.mjs`,
`tests/scalar-api-reference.test.mjs`, `tests/visual/api-reference.spec.mjs`,
and `tests/helpers/static-dir.mjs`, which gains `firstProsePageWithSidebar()`.
Nothing outside `tests/` changed.

### What still fails on a site of your own

This release does not fix any of these. Each was measured on a copy of 2.6.1
with only that change made.

In `npm test`:

- **Deleting the `petstore` example**, as its entry in
  `src/config/api-reference.mjs` tells you to, fails `the remote example is
  live, not snapshotted` in `tests/api-reference-config.test.mjs`, which expects
  exactly one remote reference. Disabling it while another reference stays on
  does the same.
- **Replacing `public/openapi.yaml` with your own document** fails three tests
  that look for this template's `payments` operations by name: two in
  `tests/openapi-sidebar.test.mjs`, and `generated sidebar anchors match the
  hashes Scalar assigns` in `tests/scalar-api-reference.test.mjs`. A document
  with fewer than ten operations fails three more, which each expect at least
  ten: two in `scalar-api-reference.test.mjs`, one in
  `tests/api-spec-equivalence.test.mjs`.
- **Removing the `payments` reference and `public/openapi.yaml`** fails eight.
  `api-spec-equivalence.test.mjs` fails to load and three tests in
  `openapi-sidebar.test.mjs` fail, because they read that file by path. The
  other four are in `scalar-api-reference.test.mjs` and expect the `payments`
  operation list at `/api/`; disabling `payments` instead fails those four too.
- **Replacing the Acme and Globex examples with private pages of your own**
  fails two. `the sentinel exists in the private source content` in
  `tests/private-leaks.test.mjs` reads the four example pages by path and wants
  its sentinel in each, as described under 2.6.0; and
  `tests/demo-login.test.mjs` finds the demo personas in
  `src/lib/demo-login.mjs` still naming `acme` and `globex`.
- **Setting `DOCS_SMOKE_URL`** runs `tests/deployed-smoke.test.mjs`, which
  requests `/reference/errors/`, `/concepts/glossary/` and
  `/get-started/quickstart/`. Those 404 on a site with its own pages, and checks
  that pass against the template fail against them until you change `PAGES` in
  that file. Measured against a local server, not a deployment.

In `npm run test:visual`, with another site's pages in place of the examples
and the Acme and Globex examples kept:

- **`tests/visual/theme-control.spec.mjs`** fails 3 of its 5 desktop tests. It
  opens `/get-started/introduction/` and clicks through to `Quickstart` and
  `Authentication` — example pages a site of your own does not have.
- **`tests/visual/auth.spec.mjs`** fails 2 tests on desktop and 7 on mobile. Its
  public page is the example `/guides/example/`, so those tests land on the 404
  page, which has no sidebar or mobile menu; one also clicks a `Quickstart`
  link.
- **The `@screenshot` test in `tests/visual/api-reference.spec.mjs`** fails,
  because its baseline is a picture of this template's sidebar. Your own pages
  change that picture, and so does deleting just the `admin` reference.
  Regenerate the baseline, as described under 2.6.0. With your own pages it is
  the only failure in that spec.

## 2.6.0

### Astro 6.4 and Starlight 0.40

Starlight 0.40 requires Astro `^6.4.5`, so the two move together. Upgrading a
fork needs two things that are easy to miss, both of which fail the build
rather than degrading quietly:

- **`overrides` must pin `"vite": "^7.3.6"`.** Astro 6.4.8 resolves Vite 8.3.0,
  and `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.3.0 fails on it with ``Missing field
  `tsconfigPaths` on BindingViteResolvePluginConfig.resolveOptions``.
- **Regenerate `package-lock.json` from scratch** — `rm -rf node_modules
  package-lock.json && npm install`. Updating it in place hoists
  `@astrojs/markdown-remark@7.1.1`, and Astro then fails with `does not provide
  an export named 'unified'`. A clean resolve hoists `7.3.1`.

`@astrojs/node` is no longer pinned to an exact `10.1.1`. That pin existed only
because the template was below Astro 6.4; it is now `^10.1.4`.

`@astrojs/markdown-satteri` appears as a new Starlight peer. It is optional —
do not install it.

**What to pull across:** the four dependency bumps — `astro`,
`@astrojs/starlight`, `@astrojs/node` and `sharp` — the `vite` override, and a
regenerated lockfile. `CustomHeader.astro` and `CustomHero.astro` are forks of
Starlight internals and were re-synced against 0.40.0; read the next section
before taking those two, and if you have customised either, re-sync yours
rather than copying these.

### Theming the header or the hero from your own CSS now works

`src/styles/global.css` is the file this template tells you to theme from, and
a rule in it aimed at the header or the hero used to do nothing at all.
`CustomHeader.astro` and `CustomHero.astro` are forks of Starlight internals,
and their `<style>` blocks were unlayered — as is a plain rule of yours, at the
same specificity — so which one won came down to source order. The components'
styles land near the end of the built stylesheet and `global.css` near the
front, so the components always came last and always won. Nothing errored and
nothing warned; your rule was simply ignored.

Re-syncing those two forks against 0.40.0 wraps their `<style>` blocks in
`@layer starlight.core`, the layer Starlight's own `Header` and `Hero` use.
Layered CSS loses to unlayered CSS whatever the specificity and whatever the
order, so your rule wins now. Measured on the built site: `.copy { gap: 5rem }`
in `global.css` against the hero's own `gap: 1rem` computed 16px before and
80px after. That is a plain CSS rule, not a Tailwind utility — though utilities
win too, as does anything you put in `@layer components`, since `starlight`
sorts before both in this template's layer order.

**The flip side:** if your fork already has unlayered CSS aimed at the header
or the hero, a rule that was losing to these overrides now takes effect, and
the page looks different with nothing failing. Read your own stylesheets for
anything that touches those two before you take this. Where a rule of yours
should still lose, put it in a layer rather than reaching for `!important` —
which is the upstream intent, and the reason `!important` is no longer the only
way to win.

With nothing competing, the change does nothing: inside this template no
computed value moves, because nothing here styles the header or the hero from
outside those two files. That tells you nothing about your fork.

**What to pull across:** the two re-synced files and `src/env.d.ts`, after
reading your own stylesheets as above.

`src/env.d.ts` is not optional here. `CustomHero.astro` now imports
`virtual:starlight/components/DraftContentNotice`, and the declaration for that
module lives in `env.d.ts` — take the two `.astro` files on their own and
`astro check` fails on a missing module, which is the failure that file's own
header comment exists to explain.

### Mermaid diagrams

A code fence tagged `mermaid` renders as a diagram, following your site's light
and dark theme. There is no component to import. One example page ships at
`/guides/diagrams/`, marked for deletion.

**What to pull across:** `astro-mermaid` (**`>=2.0.4`** — see below) and
`mermaid`, plus the `mermaid({ autoTheme: true })` entry in `integrations`,
which must sit **before** `starlight()`, since it rewrites the fence before the
syntax highlighter claims it.

**`astro-mermaid` must be at least `2.0.4`.** From Astro 6.4 an integration has
to hand its plugins to `config.markdown.processor`; 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 have no
code for that field at all and fall back to the legacy plugin arrays, which 6.4
no longer runs. The build passes, and the page renders a highlighted code block
where the diagram should be. `package.json` here asks for `^2.1.0`.

**If a diagram ever comes back as a code block, start here.** On Astro 6.4+,
`astro-mermaid` does not append to a plugin array — it replaces
`config.markdown.processor` wholesale, rebuilding it with the hoisted
`@astrojs/markdown-remark` 7.3.1 `unified()` out of options belonging to
Astro's own bundled 7.2.0 copy. A resolved tree holds four copies of that
package. It works because the guard is a duck-type check —
`isUnifiedProcessor` is `p.name === 'unified'`, true of both copies. If
upstream ever brands that processor or switches to `instanceof`, the check
fails, the integration falls back to the arrays 6.4 ignores, and the build
still passes.

### Disabling a feature no longer fails the test suite

Nine tests assumed this template's own demo configuration was live. Setting
`enabled: false` on all three API references — the supported way to drop that
feature — turned seven of them red, and deleting the Acme and Globex example
pages turned the other two red. A fork was being told to re-enable things it
had deliberately switched off.

Those nine now skip when the thing they describe is absent, and run unchanged
when it is present. **Absent means gone, not replaced.** Each skip condition
tests for an empty set — no enabled reference, no `org-docs` folder, no private
content at all. So a fork that swaps the Acme and Globex examples for private
pages of its own still fails `private-leaks`, and that is deliberate: those
tests hunt for a sentinel string that proves private content never reaches the
static output, and your pages will not contain it. The failure is the test
asking you for a sentinel of your own, not a gap in the skip.

**What to pull across:** nothing, unless you have hit this. It only changes
test files.

### The screenshot test now runs on Linux CI

`tests/visual/__screenshots__/` ships a `linux/` baseline alongside the
existing `darwin/` one, and `npm run test:visual:ci` is now an alias for
`npm run test:visual` rather than the same suite with `--grep-invert
@screenshot`. The screenshot comparison had been excluded from CI because
there was no Linux baseline to compare against — and while it was excluded, a
sidebar change shipped against a stale baseline and survived two merges before
anyone noticed.

Regenerate a Linux baseline in the Playwright image matching your
`@playwright/test` version, pinning the architecture your CI runner uses:

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v "$PWD:/work" -v docs-template-node-modules:/work/node_modules \
  -w /work mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble \
  bash -lc 'npm ci && npm run test:visual:update'
```

The named volume matters on macOS: a `node_modules` installed in the container
holds Darwin binaries that will not run on Linux, and installing over your host
copy leaves it unusable.

**What to pull across:** if your CI runs `test:visual:ci` on Linux, take the
`linux/` baseline and the `package.json` change together — the baseline alone
does nothing, and the script change alone turns your CI red. Regenerate the
baseline rather than copying this one if you have customised the API reference
sidebar at all; it is a picture of *this* template's operations.

## 2.5.0

### Markdown content negotiation is back, on Vercel

A request to any page with `Accept: text/markdown` gets the page's Markdown
twin at the same URL — the convention AI agents use to ask for Markdown without
knowing the URL shape. It shipped in 1.x as two `vercel.json` rewrites, stopped
working when 2.0.0 introduced the Vercel adapter, and was removed in 2.1.0 once
that was measured. Now it works again, by a different route.

**What to pull across:** `src/lib/vercel-markdown-negotiation.mjs` and its two
lines in `astro.config.mjs` — the `import` and the `vercelMarkdownNegotiation()`
entry in the `integrations` array. It edits the adapter's generated routing
config after the build; `vercel.json` cannot reach that file and middleware
never sees prerendered pages. Off Vercel it does nothing. Delete both lines to
turn it off. If your fork predates 2.0.0 (before the Vercel adapter shipped),
you'll also need to install `@astrojs/vercel` — the integration edits that
adapter's output and has nothing to edit without it.

**If you removed the logged-in experience,** keep `@astrojs/vercel` when you
deploy to Vercel: the integration edits its output and has nothing to edit
without it. The removal instructions in the README now say so — the adapter
line becomes `adapter: process.env.VERCEL ? vercel() : undefined`, and only
`@astrojs/node` and `jose` are uninstalled. Every page stays prerendered and
the output is still entirely static. The hosted docs site is built exactly
that way.

**Also fixed on the way:** the 1.x rewrites only matched a bare
`Accept: text/markdown`. A realistic agent header —
`text/markdown, text/plain;q=0.9, */*;q=0.8` — fell through to HTML even when
they were live. The integration now matches the media type wherever it sits.

**New tests:** `tests/markdown-negotiation.test.mjs` (unit, in `npm test`) and
`tests/deployed-smoke.test.mjs` (against a real URL, opt-in via
`DOCS_SMOKE_URL`). The second is the one that was missing: nothing in the repo
ever sent the header to a deployment, which is how 2.0.0 could break this with
CI green.

**Not on Node.** Self-hosted deployments get the twins, the alternate links and
the contextual menu, but not the header form. See
*Markdown content negotiation on Vercel* in `wiki/private-docs.md`.

## 2.4.0

### One field says where your OpenAPI document is

Each API reference used to carry two fields for one document — `spec`, a path
the build read to generate the sidebar, and `specUrl`, the address the reader's
browser fetched — and they accepted different kinds of value. Only a file in
`public/` satisfied both. A remote URL built green but lost the operation
sidebar and dropped out of search; a file elsewhere in your repository filled
the sidebar and rendered a blank page.

Now `spec` is the only field, and it takes a path or an `http(s)://` URL —
pick whichever of these three matches where your document actually is:

```js
spec: './public/openapi.yaml', // bundled, as before
// — or —
spec: '../api/openapi.yaml', // elsewhere in your repo — served for you at /api-spec/
// — or —
spec: 'https://api.example.com/openapi.yaml', // remote — fetched at build time
```

The browser URL is derived, so the two can no longer disagree. A remote
document gets the same generated sidebar and search entries as a bundled one,
and an optional `serve` chooses how readers load it: `'snapshot'` (the default)
serves the copy the build fetched from your own site — no CORS setup, and
nothing goes blank when the API host is down — while `'live'` has the browser
fetch the URL directly so the reference is always current.

If the build is responsible for serving a document and can't obtain it — a
snapshot URL that's unreachable, a file that isn't there — the build now fails
naming the source and the reason, rather than shipping a blank reference. A
remote fetch is capped at 30 seconds, and a URL that answers with an HTML page
(a sign-in screen, a single-page app's catch-all) is rejected as not being a
document rather than quietly rendering an empty reference.

Derived URLs carry your site's `base`, so a docs site deployed on a subpath
serves its documents from under that prefix like everything else.

**Upgrading:** an entry that still sets `specUrl` keeps working unchanged; the
value is used as-is. See
[API reference](https://potluck.ekline.io/api-reference/)
for the three cases.

### A third example reference, fetched over the network

The two example references were both files in `public/`, so the remote case was
documented but never visible. There's now a third at `/api/petstore/` pointing
at a public OpenAPI document over the internet, so you can see that a spec you
don't host produces the same generated operation sidebar and the same search
entries as a bundled one.

It uses `serve: 'live'` rather than the default, deliberately: a snapshot the
build can't fetch fails that build, which is right for your own API and wrong
for an example that would then break the first build of anyone working offline.

**It is the only part of this template that reaches the network**, so your
build and your tests now depend on that host being up. It documents someone
else's pet store — delete its entry from `src/config/api-reference.mjs` once
you've seen it work, and your build has no third-party dependency again.

### Config mistakes are now caught by name

Errors that used to build green and misbehave quietly now stop the build and
say which reference and which field:

- `serve` set on a `spec` that is a file rather than a URL. It only decides how
  a *remote* document reaches the browser, so on a file it does nothing —
  previously `'live'` was rejected but `'snapshot'` was silently ignored.
- Two references sharing an `id`, or an `id` containing anything but letters,
  digits, dots, dashes and underscores. `id` names the file this site serves
  the document from, so a slash in it silently pointed the page at a path
  nothing served.
- A `spec` that starts `http://` or `https://` but isn't a parseable URL.

If your existing configuration trips one of these, the message names the fix.

## 2.3.0

### A new light / dark control, and a config for it

The header's theme control was Starlight's native `<select>` with its label
collapsed away — an icon, a caret, and an operating-system dropdown no
stylesheet could reach. It has been replaced.

What you get by default is a trigger the same size as the old one, opening a
popover the site actually themes: Light, Auto and Dark stacked, with a check on
the current one. Two other shapes are one line away, in a new
`src/config/theme.mjs`:

```js
export const themeControl = 'menu'; // 'menu' | 'segmented' | 'none'
export const pinnedTheme = 'auto'; // 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto'
```

`'segmented'` puts all three choices on screen at once, in a pill with a
sliding thumb: any theme in one click and the current one legible at rest, for
about 92px of header width rather than 28.

`'none'` takes the control out of the header and the mobile menu and pins the
site to `pinnedTheme`. The pin beats a theme a reader chose earlier, so
everyone sees the same site — and their old preference is ignored rather than
erased, so turning the control back on hands it back to them.
`pinnedTheme: 'auto'` is the middle option: no control, but the site still
follows each reader's operating system.

Readers who have chosen nothing still get Auto, and a reader who chose a theme
on your site before this upgrade keeps it — the storage key and its convention
are unchanged.

### If you have customised the theme control

- **`src/styles/global.css` lost a block.** The rules that collapsed
  Starlight's `<select>` to an icon are gone, because the `<select>` is. If you
  copied or extended them, they now target an element the template does not
  render.
- **Starlight's `ThemeProvider` is overridden too**, at
  `src/components/ThemeProvider.astro`. It writes `data-theme` before first
  paint as upstream does, and additionally enforces the pin and re-applies the
  theme after every `<ClientRouter />` swap. Upstream survived those swaps only
  because the theme control's custom element was rebuilt by them, which stops
  being true once `themeControl` is `'none'`.

Configuration guidance is on the hosted docs under
[Branding and theming](https://potluck.ekline.io/branding/);
the mechanics are in `wiki/theming.md`.

## 2.2.0

### There is now hosted documentation

<https://potluck.ekline.io>

Configuration guides for everything the template does — branding, navigation,
API references and their two layout modes, the logged-in experience, and a
reference section covering every environment variable and command. The
constraints documents that ship in `wiki/` are published there too, under
*Internals*, so you can read them without a checkout.

The README is shorter as a result. What needed a browser is on the site now;
what you need before you have one — the create command, the commands table,
deployment essentials, and the full removal steps — stays in the README.

### `robots.txt`

Your build now emits one. It points crawlers at your sitemap and keeps them out
of `/private/`, which spares them a walk that only ever returns redirects.

It is generated from `site` rather than shipped as a static file, so it is
correct wherever you deploy without you editing it — including preview
deployments, and including a site built with a `base` path, where the
disallowed prefix follows the base. Until you replace the `https://example.com`
placeholder in `astro.config.mjs`, it deliberately advertises no sitemap at all
rather than pointing crawlers at a domain you do not own.

`Disallow` is not access control — `src/middleware.ts` is, and it answers a
redirect or a 404 to anyone unauthenticated. Delete `src/pages/robots.txt.ts`
if you would rather write your own.

## 2.1.0

### How you create a site from this template has changed

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template ekline-io/potluck-docs/packages/template
```

The GitHub **"Use this template"** button no longer works for this, and the
README no longer suggests it. The template now lives in `packages/template/`
inside a monorepo — that button copies whole repositories, so it would hand you
EkLine's build tooling and its own hosted sites along with the template. The
command above fetches exactly the template directory, lockfile included.

Nothing inside your site changes: the files you receive are byte-for-byte what
the previous version shipped. Only the way you fetch them is different, and
existing sites are unaffected — you already have your copy.

One consequence worth knowing: `npm create astro` strips `CHANGELOG.md` from a
fetched template, so your copy will not include this file. It records the
template's history rather than your site's, and it stays readable in the
repository.

### Demo login

`/demo-login` — a persona picker that plays your product's part in the SSO
handshake, so the logged-in experience can be demonstrated and evaluated with
no real SSO endpoint behind it. Off unless `DOCS_UNSAFE_DEMO_LOGIN=1` *and*
the three `DOCS_*` variables are set; a deployment that does not opt in is
unaffected in every reachable way, and the route answers 404. The name is the warning:
it accepts anyone, so it is for demo and staging deployments only — never a
site with real private content. See *The demo login* in `wiki/private-docs.md`.

Three fake readers ship with it (Acme, Globex, no-org — matching the example
org folders), so org isolation is visible in two clicks. Edit them in
`src/lib/demo-login.mjs`.

### Other

- `site` in `astro.config.mjs` can now come from a `DOCS_SITE_URL` env var, so one
  config serves deployments at different URLs. The placeholder default is
  unchanged.
- **The `vercel.json` markdown-twin rewrites are removed.** They served the
  `.md` twins on an `Accept: text/markdown` header, and they stopped working
  when 2.0.0 introduced the Vercel adapter — its generated routing config
  supersedes them. Measured on a real deployment rather than assumed. Nothing
  linked to the header-negotiated form (the contextual menu deep-links to the
  `.md` route), so the twins are unaffected; only a mechanism nothing used has
  gone. Self-hosting behind your own proxy, you can still negotiate on the
  header there.
- **`npm run test:visual` no longer needs port 4321.** It ran the site under
  `astro preview`, which reports a fixed `http://localhost:4321` origin whatever
  port it listens on — so the SSO round trip only worked on that one port, and a
  developer with anything else there could not run the suite. It now runs the
  Node adapter's standalone entry point, which reports the real port. Set
  `DOCS_TEST_PORT` to move it (default 4331); the mock SSO port follows
  `DOCS_SSO_URL` in `.env.test`. Ports live in `tests/helpers/test-servers.mjs`.

## 2.0.0

Adds a logged-in experience: documentation that only signed-in readers can see,
and sections written for one customer that only that customer can reach.

A major version because the build output moved. If you deploy anywhere other
than Vercel, read *Upgrading* at the end of this entry before pulling it across.

### Private and per-org documentation

Three levels of access, all enforced on the server:

| | Lives in | Who sees it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public | `src/content/docs/` | everyone, prerendered exactly as before |
| Private | `src/content/private-docs/` | any signed-in reader, at `/private/…` |
| Per-org | `src/content/org-docs/<org>/` | only members of that org, at `/private/orgs/<org>/…` |

**Readers sign in through your product.** The docs site has no user database, no
signup and no password field — it hands the reader to an endpoint you implement
(about twenty lines; the README has it) and trades a short-lived signed token
for its own session cookie. Access follows your existing users and permissions,
including revocation, and readers never learn a second credential.

**Private content cannot leak, structurally rather than by configuration.** It
lives outside the `docs` collection and is never prerendered, so it is not
present in the build for Pagefind, `llms.txt`, the sitemap or the `.md` twin
routes to find. `tests/private-leaks.test.mjs` asserts it on every `npm test`,
searching raw bytes and inflating Pagefind's gzipped index so the check cannot
pass by looking in the wrong place.

**A wrong org is a 404, never a 403.** A 403 would confirm the org exists, and
org names are customer names. The refusal is byte-identical to the one for an
org that does not exist — asserted by a test that compares the two responses.

### Signing in, from the reader's side

- A **Log in / Log out** control sits in the header, next to the theme toggle,
  and in the mobile menu. Public pages are prerendered and identical for every
  visitor, so the swap is decided client-side from a content-free cookie read
  before first paint: no flash, no extra request, and public pages stay
  CDN-cacheable.
- The sidebar's **Private docs** entry appears only once a reader is signed in,
  so nobody is offered a section they cannot open. Org sections are deliberately
  *not* handled this way — those labels are customer names, and prerendered HTML
  would hand every one of them to every anonymous visitor.
- **Nothing is offered on a deployment that cannot honour it.** With the
  `DOCS_*` variables unset, the control and the sidebar entry are absent from
  the build entirely — no dead link on a demo, a staging site, or a fork that
  has not wired SSO yet. Derived from configuration, not a flag to remember.

### Breaking: the build output moved

There is no longer a flat `dist/` you can host anywhere. Private docs need a
server runtime, so an adapter is now wired in:

- **Vercel** builds (`VERCEL=1` is set automatically) use `@astrojs/vercel`;
  static files land in `.vercel/output/static/`.
- **Everywhere else** uses `@astrojs/node`; static files land in `dist/client/`
  and the server in `dist/server/`.

Public pages are still prerendered in both cases — only `/private/**` and
`/auth/**` render on demand, so the public site keeps its CDN behaviour.

Netlify, Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Pages need attention: an unmodified
template hands them the Node adapter, which none of them runs. Swap in that
platform's adapter, or remove the feature and get the flat `dist/` back. The
README's Deploy table says which.

### Breaking: three new dependencies

`@astrojs/node`, `@astrojs/vercel` and `jose`. `@astrojs/node` is pinned to
exactly `10.1.1`, and the pin is load-bearing: 10.1.2 began importing an Astro
export that only exists from 6.4, while still declaring a peer of `^6.3.0` — so
a caret range resolves cleanly, reports no peer warning, and then fails the
build inside Rollup. Raise the adapter and Astro together, or neither.

### Also

- `astro.config.mjs` filters `/private/` out of the sitemap. `@astrojs/sitemap`
  never consults `isPrerendered`, so a non-dynamic on-demand page under that
  prefix would otherwise be advertised to crawlers.
- `npm run dev:sso` starts a mock SSO server, so `npm run dev` has a working
  sign-in locally with nothing to configure beyond copying `.env.example`.
- `wiki/private-docs.md` documents the constraints that keep this safe. Several
  exist because a bypass was found and measured; the file says which and why.

### Upgrading from 1.x

Nothing about your existing content, theming or API references changed. Public
pages render exactly as they did.

1. **Check your deploy target.** If you are on Vercel, nothing to do. Otherwise
   your publish directory changes from `dist/` to `dist/client/`, and Netlify,
   Cloudflare and GitHub Pages need the adapter swapped or the feature removed.
2. **Don't want private docs at all?** The README's *Don't need private docs?*
   section lists the files to delete — including the `adapter` and `env` entries
   in `astro.config.mjs` and the three dependencies. Skip that second half and
   the build keeps emitting a server bundle you have no use for.
3. **Want them?** Copy `src/middleware.ts`, `src/config/auth.mjs`,
   `src/lib/auth/`, `src/lib/private-sidebar.mjs`, `src/lib/sidebar-items.mjs`,
   `src/pages/private/`, `src/pages/auth/` and the two content collections, then
   set the three environment variables from `.env.example` and implement the
   SSO endpoint from the README.
4. **If you have customised `src/config/sidebar.mjs`**, note it now also exports
   `privateDocsLink`, which `astro.config.mjs` includes only when SSO is
   configured.

Read [`wiki/private-docs.md`](wiki/private-docs.md) before changing anything
under `src/pages/private/`, `src/pages/auth/` or `src/middleware.ts`.

## 1.0.0

The first tagged release. The template has been in use before now; this marks
the point where it has a version worth quoting.

### Interactive API references, rendered by Scalar

The headline change. API documentation is rendered by
[Scalar](https://scalar.com/) through its official Astro integration, replacing
the previous `starlight-openapi` setup. Readers get schemas, examples, and a
built-in client that sends real requests without leaving the page.

- **Two example APIs ship, one per layout**, so you can see both before
  choosing: a dense payments API in the `docs` layout at `/api/`, and a wide,
  flat admin API in the full-width layout at `/api/admin/`. Delete whichever you
  do not need — removing its entry from `src/config/api-reference.mjs` takes its
  route, sidebar entries and search entries with it.
- **Every operation appears in the docs sidebar**, generated from your OpenAPI
  document on each build and reachable from any page in the site. Swap the
  document and the sidebar follows; there is nothing to maintain by hand.
- **The site's own search covers the API.** Searching for an endpoint returns
  it and links straight to the operation, rather than only finding the guides
  that mention it.
- **One theme.** The reference takes its colours, fonts and dark mode from
  `src/styles/global.css` like everything else, so retheming the site rethemes
  the reference.
- **Scalar's product surfaces are off by default** — its AI assistant, the
  links out to scalar.com, and the platform toolbar. The AI assistant in
  particular uploads your OpenAPI document to Scalar's servers, which is not a
  default a template should choose for you. Each is one line to restore;
  `wiki/api-reference.md` lists them.

Everything about the references is configured in
[`src/config/api-reference.mjs`](src/config/api-reference.mjs). See
[`wiki/api-reference.md`](wiki/api-reference.md) for the full guide.

### Continuous integration

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs type checking, the build, the output tests and
  the browser tests on every pull request. The Vercel build already ran `npm test`;
  this adds the checks that gated nothing.
- `npm run check` (`astro check`) is now clean and enforced. Getting there meant
  adding `src/env.d.ts`, which types the Starlight virtual modules the Header and
  Search overrides import.
- Browser tests via Playwright: `npm run test:visual`. These cover the parts
  that build cleanly and behave wrongly — theme, search, navigation, and the API
  client's stacking.

### Accessibility

- The footer credit met 2.63:1 in light and 2.35:1 in dark against a 4.5:1
  minimum, on every page. Fixed.
- The API reference's method badges and syntax colours were between 2.9:1 and
  4.35:1 in light mode. Corrected to clear 4.5:1 with the hues unchanged, so the
  blue-GET / green-POST convention still reads.

### Upgrading from the pre-Scalar template

If you have already customised a copy and want the API reference:

1. Remove `starlight-openapi` and its `plugins` entry, and delete
   `src/schemas/api.yaml`.
2. Copy `src/config/api-reference.mjs`, `src/lib/openapi-sidebar.mjs`,
   `src/pages/api/`, and the `ApiSearchIndex` and `ScalarApiReference`
   components.
3. Put your OpenAPI document at `public/openapi.yaml` and point the config at it.
4. Add the `overrides` entry from `package.json` — `@scalar/astro` still
   declares Astro `^4 || ^5` as a peer, so a plain `npm install` fails on Astro 6
   without it.

Nothing outside the API reference changed, so the rest of a customised site
carries over untouched.
